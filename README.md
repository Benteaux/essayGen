A handful of language models finetuned on essays I wrote during highschool



This repository is meant to store a handful of language models, finetuned or trained on essays I wrote during highschool. These language models are:

1. A homemade Transformer [ FINSIHED ] (2.4 loss achieved)
2. LLAMA 3, 8B [ IN PROGRESS ]
3. Mistral [ NOT STARTED ]
4. A homemade Mixture of Experts [ NOT STARTED ]


The goal is to find out if I can create or finetune a language model to write essays in my writing style. This is purely for educational purposes to help me gain more familiarity with language models (and to satisfy my curiosity), and I will not use any of these models to write essays for me in any academic setting, nor do I condone doing so, as such an action would violate academic integrity.
