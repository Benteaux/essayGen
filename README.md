A couple of language models trained on essays I wrote during highschool



This repository is meant to store a couple of language models trained on essays I wrote during highschool in an effort to help me learn more about current NLP practices. These language models are:

1. A homemade Transformer [ FINSIHED ] (2.4 loss achieved)
4. A homemade Mixture of Experts [ FINISHED ] (0.46 loss achieved)


The goal was to find out if I could create a language model to write essays in my writing style. This is purely for educational purposes to help me gain more familiarity with language models (and to satisfy my curiosity), and I will not use any of these models to write essays for me in any academic setting, nor do I condone doing so, as such an action would violate academic integrity.
